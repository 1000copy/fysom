## Better Versions

Unfortunately I don't get time to add unit tests or improve on this
anymore (as I don't use it much if at all) but there are other forks of
fysom that you should definitely check out:

 * [Maximilien Riehl's](https://github.com/mriehl/fysom) smoothened fork
   with 100% test coverage and install scripts. He's also made it
   available through PyPi (easily installable using
   `pip install fysom`).

 * [Bartosz Ptaszynski's](https://github.com/foobarto/fysom) beefed up
   version with per event+state callbacks and multiple destination event
   choices.

## Usage

See the pydoc in fysom.py
